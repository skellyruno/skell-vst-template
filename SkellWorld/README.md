# SkellWorld — the SKELL plugin ecosystem

SkellWorld is the **connection layer** above SkellCore, not a replacement for the existing audio engines. Plugin IDs, presets, DSP, latency contracts and existing DAW sessions must remain unchanged.

## What's implemented in v1

- **Identity** — every newly generated plugin has `skellworld.json`, a stable product ID, and an independent runtime instance ID.
- **Wire protocol** — `SkellCore/World.h` defines strict, versioned `SW1` messages limited to 255 bytes, with input validation and a fixed-size single-producer/single-consumer mailbox.
- **Local hub** — `tools/skellworld_hub.py` relays presence events across different plugin processes, plus *informational* events for theme, preset name, transport and level. It binds only to IPv4 loopback `127.0.0.1:48673`.
- **JUCE bridge** — `SkellCore/WorldLink.h` connects from a worker thread. No sockets, locks, Python or allocations are added to an audio-processing callback. A JOIN/LEAVE control in the template provides explicit consent.
- **Lifecycle** — the connection is owned by the plugin processor. Closing or reopening its editor does not disconnect a joined instance.
- **Catalog** — `catalog.json` inventories SKELL GitHub plugin repositories, including best-effort VST3 plugin-code/bundle metadata. Entries marked `planned` are **not** yet connected. The generator refuses codes that collide with catalogued products.

## Try the first connected world

On Windows, double-click **`Start-SkellWorld.bat`** in the template folder (Python 3 must be installed). Alternatively, open a terminal in the template checkout:

```sh
python tools/skellworld_hub.py
```

Launch two instances of the **Skell Quickstart** VST3 (or Standalone) and click **JOIN WORLD** in both editors. Each joined instance should show **WORLD ONLINE | 1 peers**. Closing a plugin editor does not disconnect its audio processor; re-opening shows the current world status. Clicking **LEAVE WORLD** disconnects only that instance.

All plugins still work without this helper app. No connection starts automatically, and the helper does not run at machine startup. It uses only the Python standard library. This localhost v1 bus is intentionally **not** a cloud service.

## Core event schema

Each wire line has five fields and is newline terminated:

```
SW1|HELLO|<instance-id>|<product-id>|<display-name>
SW1|WELCOME|hub|status|connected
SW1|PEER|<instance-id>|<product-id>|online
SW1|PEER|<instance-id>|<product-id>|offline
SW1|EVENT|<instance-id>|theme|neon
```

These events are informational. They must never be interpreted as a remote request to adjust host parameters, apply a preset, load files, expose audio, change latency, or execute commands. Only the originating plugin or user may authorize control actions.

**Transport rules:** product and instance tokens contain only ASCII letters/digits/period/underscore/hyphen; values are short printable ASCII without pipes, backslashes or control characters. Max line = 255 bytes; max peers = 32; max input rate per peer = 30 messages/sec. Version mismatch or malformed input disconnects the sender.

## Performance and safety

- Connecting creates one background worker per joined plugin instance; **disabled by default**.
- Worker wakes on infrequent socket checks and its only shared state with the editor is an atomic online/peer count and bounded SPSC event queue.
- Each core DSP/GUI thread remains unaffected; do **not** call `join`, `leave` or `publish` from `processBlock`.
- Hub is loopback-only, but other local processes can still send spoofed informational events. There is **no authentication or encryption in v1**. Therefore this protocol deliberately has no control messages, no private data, and no preset file transfers.
- For future user-controlled remote actions, use an authenticated, permissioned broker with explicit destination and sender approval; do not upgrade v1 EVENT to executable commands.

## Roadmap to one integrated SKELL world

1. **Now:** stable product identity, local peer presence and safe information routing (template demo complete).
2. **Next:** integrate WorldLink into select existing plugins through separate PRs, preserving sound, VST3 IDs, preset formats and UI defaults. Test each plugin under FL Studio before merging.
3. **Shared assets:** optional theme and preset metadata browsing. A preset name is not a preset file. Never silently overwrite a plugin's settings.
4. **Central app:** SKELL Hub provides a visible world map of plugins, connected sessions, theme controls, installed products and optional downloads, with explicit consent.
5. **Cross-plugin workflows:** optional transport alignment and preset-chain workflows, not sample-accurate audio routing. DAW host handles actual audio/MIDI order and plugin delay compensation.
6. **Future:** authenticated local agent, and optional cloud accounts/licensing only with a separately reviewed privacy model.

## Validate

```sh
cmake -S SkellCore -B build-world -DSKELLCORE_BUILD_TESTS=ON
cmake --build build-world --config Release
ctest --test-dir build-world -C Release --output-on-failure
python -m unittest discover -s SkellWorld/tests -v
```

Windows VST3 and Standalone builds compile the JUCE WorldLink. A real two-instance FL Studio smoke test is still needed before declaring DAW-level integration complete.

## SkellKey ↔ SkellyTune musical connection (SkellCore v0.6)

SkellCore provides `WorldMusical.h`, a canonical `root.mode` payload (C=0 through B=11; major=0, natural minor=1), and `WorldLink::publishMusicalKey` / `latestMusicalKey`. The hub only accepts `musical.key` events from a peer registered as `skell.key` and validates payloads. A tuner must explicitly opt into **FOLLOW SKELL KEY** before interpreting an incoming event; v1 is **not authenticated** and must not be used for arbitrary commands or privileged controls.

`SkullTheme.h` shares four UI skins and the original vector skull-key emblem from SkellKey; palette selection is per plugin instance and performed only on the message/UI thread. The skins are Ossuary (existing SkellKey colors), Neon, Ivory and Obsidian.

These foundational APIs are independent of the current SkellyTune DSP and do not add host parameters, network traffic in `processBlock`, or alter preset/latency contracts. Individual Key and Tune repositories must adopt the API in separate tested PRs.

## Pilot plugins (merged SKELL code, physical host test pending)

- **SkellKey**: `skell.key` publishes stable major/minor key detections; original scene click still previews audio, header skull changes shared UI skins. Separate existing MIDI-scale output is not this connection.
- **SkellyTune mini**: `skell.tune` follows only after JOIN WORLD + FOLLOW SKELLKEY in MORE. Temporary mask override never overwrites saved key/scale or manual note mask; skull in header cycles shared skins.

SkellCore's own Quickstart example also supports skull-click skins. All integration code is merged, but manual FL Studio two-plugin and low-end-PC testing remains outstanding. Source validation alone does not prove live DAW routing.
